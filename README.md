# **Structured Error Handling / Pickling**
## **1.0 Introduction**

In this week, the topics covered were structured error handling / pickling. 

In this assignment, structured error handling and pickling will be explained along with code demos to show their functionality. A final script will be presented that incorporates both demos into a combined script based on a modification of assignments 05, 06, and Lab 7-1. 

## **2.0 Python Error Types**

There are 2 types of errors in Python: syntax and exception errors [2]. Syntax errors occur when the code has incorrect statements (ie. mismatched brackets). Exception errors occur when syntactically correct Python code results in an error [3]. In this assignment, exception errors will be covered.
